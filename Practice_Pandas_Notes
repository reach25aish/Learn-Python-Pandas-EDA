Data Analysis:
***************
Data analysis is the act of turning raw, messy data into useful insights by cleaning the data up, transforming it, manipulating it, and inspecting it.

Pandas:
**********
Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of python programming language.

Creating data¶
****************
There are two core objects in pandas: the DataFrame and the Series.

DataFrame
************
A DataFrame is a table. It contains an array of individual entries, each of which has a certain value. Each entry corresponds to a row (or record) and a column.
pd.DataFrame({'Yes': [50, 21], 'No': [131, 2]})

Series¶
**************
A Series, by contrast, is a sequence of data values. If a DataFrame is a table, a Series is a list. And in fact you can create one with nothing more than a list:
pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])


Reading data files¶
*******************
Being able to create a DataFrame or Series by hand is handy. 
But, most of the time, we won't actually be creating our own data by hand. Instead, we'll be working with data that already exists.

Data can be stored in any of a number of different forms and formats. By far the most basic of these is the humble CSV file. 
Let's now set aside our toy datasets and see what a real dataset looks like when we read it into a DataFrame. 

read_csv()
***********
We'll use the pd.read_csv() function to read the data into a DataFrame. This goes thusly:
wine_reviews = pd.read_csv("../input/wine-reviews/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv")

We can use the shape attribute to check how large the resulting DataFrame is:

Shape()
*********
wine_reviews.shape   --> Shows Rows, Columns of the data frame
(129971, 14) 

head()
*******
wine_reviews.head()
shows the first five rows

For example, you can see in this dataset that the CSV file has a built-in index, which pandas did not pick up on automatically. 
To make pandas use that column for the index (instead of creating a new one from scratch), we can specify an index_col.
wine_reviews = pd.read_csv("../input/wine-reviews/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv", index_col=0)
wine_reviews.head()

Tail()
********
wine_reviews.tail()
shows the last five rows

info()
********
wine_reviews.info()
shows the column name and data types of the data frames.
