Data Analysis:

Data analysis is the act of turning raw, messy data into useful insights by cleaning the data up, transforming it, manipulating it, and inspecting it.

Pandas:

Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of python programming language.

Creating data¶
There are two core objects in pandas: the DataFrame and the Series.

DataFrame
A DataFrame is a table. It contains an array of individual entries, each of which has a certain value. Each entry corresponds to a row (or record) and a column.

Series¶
A Series, by contrast, is a sequence of data values. If a DataFrame is a table, a Series is a list. And in fact you can create one with nothing more than a list:
